# BeamSolve

https://beamsolve.herokuapp.com/

This webapp was created for my Final Year Project in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to analyse beams structures. It uses the [Direct Stiffness Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_stiffness_method) to determine the Bending Moments & Shear Forces of the inputted beam. It was developed with a Python & Flask backend. Backend calculations are computed using [anaStruct](https://anastruct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
